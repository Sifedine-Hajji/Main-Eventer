## Goal of this project

For this project, we needed to learn how to work as a team, keep track of our work in an organized fashion. This way everyone knows exactly what their tasks are, what tasks the others are doing, and keeping a clear structure of the stages of task completion on Trello. Working in a team was not the only thing we learned however, we needed our result to be as close as possible to the the prototype to satisfy the customer. For this project we had to keep in mind semantics and good code practices of course.

## How did we do it?

- We broke down the project webpage into sections and delegated the different sections as tasks between ourselves to complete on our own branches We didn't hesitate to help each other when someone faced a problem.
- We decide to make comments of the sections of code relatively early. This allowed for an easier branch merge and an easier understanding of the different sections near the end.
- We exchanged some bits of universal code like the font colors.
- When we merged, we did it in our group's vocal channel "Group 7" **Kelian's favourite group - scientifically proven** and with screen sharing.

## Difficulties

Merging was both easy and not easy. Communicating what we each needed exactly was sometimes tricky because all our minds work differently and concequently we code differently. It's a learning process and it'll take time and practice. However we believe this was a experience to have been exposed to, because this will happen very often in a work environment, so learning to adapt to others now is a great advantage!
